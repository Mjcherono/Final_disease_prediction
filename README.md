# Final_disease_prediction
In cities where dengue is present, the disease is endemic. Globally, researchers estimate that dengue infects 390 million people per year ; however, only 50â€“100 million cases are detected due to the high asymptomatic rate . Estimating dengue burden can be problematic due to delays in case identification, strong intra- and inter-annual variation in incidence, and the majority of cases being clinically mild or asymptomatic . As a result, implementing effective vector control operations can be challenging. To overcome these issues, the development of accurate and timely early warnings systems capable of predicting future dengue incidence needs to be done.
